Mega Project List
========

A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language (See [solutions](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects-Solutions)). These projects are divided in multiple categories, and each category has it's own folder.

Some details about this repo:

* I will use Python to solve these. Why? Because I want to learn the language quickly.
* I have no interest in making games, so I'm excluding those from the list below.
* I'm not interested in networking, so I *might* skip all (or some) of them.
* The projects will not be made in the order posted.
* I may not be able to complete all of them. 
* My method of solving them may not be the best. If you do not like my algorithm(s), please add a comment for the file/commit or open an issue, and I'll try to improve.
